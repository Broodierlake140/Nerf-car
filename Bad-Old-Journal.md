	I started researching a nerf guns mechanism
		
  	6:37 Pm ATD 
	I started looking on aliexpress for some nerf bullets
			
  	6:50 Pm ATD
	Added my Github to the submit.yml and going to work on the ReadMe.md

 	7:01 Pm ATD
  	I finished with fixing the Readme so i'm going back to aliexpress to find springs and a o-ring

 	7:08 Pm ATD
  	I'm taking a break.

  	7:21 Pm ATD
  	thinking on how to use a single servo to hold the spring in place while allowing the spring to be unsprung by it turning

	7:35 Pm ATD
  	Decided to make a winch box by having a motor attached to a gear and wire unravelling enough wire to allow the spring to fully extend and 
	allowing for easy repulling with a lock so that when the spring is released it fully extends instantly.

 	7:37 Pm ATD 
  	Trying to fix the formatting, again

   	7:40 Pm ATD
	Small Break

  	7:43 Pm ATD
   	Looking for O-ring and spring still

	8:29 Pm ATD
 	I'm resuming looking for an o-ring possibly 20mm wide

	May 15 7:36 ATD
	I ended up not coming back from the break, got disctracted.
